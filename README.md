It's a hackathon project. This app may not have a very beautiful UI but I gave it my best shot. 
I gave flutter a try for the first time and it was a great experience. I learned a lot of new things and I am really happy with the result.
(PS- I am a React Native developer to the core. I was just curious to try flutter.)
